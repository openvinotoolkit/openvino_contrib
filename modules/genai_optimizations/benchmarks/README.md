<summary><b>Large Language Models Optimization Example: LongBench</b></summary>

This [example](./longbench.py) demonstrates how to evaluate and optimize LLMs using the [LongBench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14508), a bilingual, multi-task benchmark designed to assess long-context understanding. LongBench includes 21 datasets across six task categories—single-document QA, multi-document QA, summarization, few-shot learning, synthetic reasoning, and code completion—in both English and Chinese.

Sparse attention speeds up the prefill stage in LLMs by attending only to the most relevant query-key blocks. Static patterns like Tri-Shape and dynamic mechanisms like XAttention reduce memory and computation without significant accuracy loss, enabling efficient handling of long prompts.

### Run Example

```bash
python longbench.py \
    --subset samsum \
    --model meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct \
    --use_custom_attention \
    --prefill_impl tri-shape \
    --enable_eviction \
    --algorithm h2o \
    --granularity per_group \
    --normalize_scores \
    --intermediate_tokens 1024
```
This will automatically:

- Download the selected model and dataset
- Apply sparse attention computation during the prefill stage
- Apply token eviction during the decoding stage
- Evaluate the model and report the score

<summary><b>Multimodal Large Language Models Optimization Example: MME Benchmark</b></summary>

This [example](./mmebench.py) demonstrates how to evaluate and optimize MLLMs using the [MME benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13394), which measures both perception and cognition abilities across 14 subtasks. Its concise instruction design enables fair comparison of MLLMs without the need for extensive prompt engineering.

Visual token pruning enables significant acceleration of inference in VLMs, where the number of input visual tokens is often much larger than the number of textual tokens. By pruning these tokens, we reduce first-token latency and overall FLOPs while preserving accuracy.

Sparse attention speeds up the prefill stage in LLMs and MMLLMs by attending only to the most relevant query-key blocks. Static patterns like Tri-Shape and dynamic mechanisms like XAttention reduce memory and computation without significant accuracy loss, enabling efficient handling of long prompts, high-resolution images, and multi-frame videos.

### Run Example

```bash
python mmebench.py \
    --subset artwork \
    --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct \
    --enable_visual_pruning \
    --num_keep_tokens 128 \
    --theta 0.5 \
    --use_custom_attention \
    --prefill_impl x-attention \
    --enable_eviction \
    --algorithm snapkv \
    --granularity per_group \
    --window_size 8
```
This will automatically:

- Download the selected model and dataset
- Apply the visual token pruning algorithm
- Apply sparse attention computation during the prefill stage
- Apply token eviction during the decoding stage
- Evaluate the model and report the score

<summary><b>Multimodal Large Language Models Optimization Example: MileBench</b></summary>

This [example](./milebench.py) demonstrates how to optimize MLLMs using an experimental visual token pruning algorithm. The example leverages [MileBench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18532), a pioneering benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the multimodal long-context capabilities of MLLMs. MileBench encompasses diverse tasks requiring both comprehension and generation, and introduces two distinct evaluation sets— diagnostic and realistic — that systematically assess models’ capacity for long-context adaptation and effective task completion.


### Run Example

```bash
python milebench.py \
    --subset WikiVQA \
    --model Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct \
    --enable_visual_pruning \
    --num_keep_tokens 64 \
    --theta 0.5 \
    --use_custom_attention \
    --prefill_impl tri-shape \
    --enable_eviction \
    --algorithm snapkv \
    --granularity per_group \
    --window_size 8
```

This will automatically:

- Download the selected model and dataset
- Apply the visual token pruning algorithm
- Apply sparse attention computation during the prefill stage
- Apply token eviction during the decoding stage
- Evaluate the model and report the score
