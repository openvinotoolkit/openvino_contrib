# OpenVino training kit

Wrappers for scikit-learn and PyTorch models with OpenVINO optimization.

## About

This module provides easy-to-use wrappers for training, evaluating, and exporting classical (scikit-learn) and deep learning (PyTorch) models optimized for OpenVINO, targeting local AI PCs and edge deployment.


## System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+), Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2019+
- **CPU:** x86-64 (Intel or AMD)
- **Python:** 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- **RAM:** 8GB+ recommended
- **GPU:** Optional (not required)
- **Note:** Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) is only supported on Linux/Windows with x86-64 CPUs. On MacOS, some features may not be available.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ov-training-kit
```
